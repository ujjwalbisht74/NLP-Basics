### Table of Content

#### Introduction
  
  - What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
  - Why NLP is important and its applications

#### Text Preprocessing

  - Tokenization: Breaking text into words or tokens
  - Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words that don't carry significant meaning
  - Text Normalization: Converting text to a standard form (lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization)
  - Cleaning: Removing special characters, punctuation, and unwanted symbols

#### Text Representation

  - Bag-of-Words (BoW): Representing text as a numerical vector
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A weight to identify the importance of words in a document

#### Sentiment Analysis

  - Understanding sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in text
  - Using sentiment analysis for product reviews, social media, and more

#### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

  - Identifying entities (names, locations, organizations) in text
  - Applications in information extraction and question answering systems

#### Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)

  - Assigning grammatical tags to words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
  - Understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence

#### Word Embeddings

  - Word2Vec and GloVe: Techniques to represent words as dense vectors
  - Utilizing word embeddings for similarity and word analogy tasks

#### Topic Modeling

  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): Identifying topics in a collection of documents
  - Extracting insights from large text corpora

#### Text Classification

  - Building classifiers to categorize text into predefined classes
  - Use cases in spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization

#### Language Translation

  - Machine Translation using sequence-to-sequence models
  - Understanding the challenges in language translation

#### Future Developments and Advanced NLP Techniques
